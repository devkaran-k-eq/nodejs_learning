Given that you're new to Next.js but have a React background, and you're watching videos on key Next.js concepts like nested routing, dynamic routing, catch-all routes, layouts, metadata, custom 404 pages, and route groups, I’ll suggest a beginner-friendly yet presentable project that incorporates these features. The goal is to create something simple, functional, and quick to build while showcasing what you’ve learned.

### Project Idea: Personal Blog with Dynamic Posts and Categories
A blog is a great way to demonstrate Next.js routing, layouts, and metadata while keeping it beginner-friendly. You can complete it quickly (in a day or two) and make it look polished for presentation.

#### Why this project?
- It uses nested and dynamic routing for blog posts and categories.
- It leverages reusable layouts for consistent design.
- It includes metadata for SEO (e.g., page titles).
- It can feature a custom 404 page for invalid routes.
- It’s expandable with catch-all routes for future features.

#### Features to Include (Mapped to Your Videos):
1. **Homepage** (Basic static page)
   - A simple landing page with a list of blog post titles or categories.
   - Skills: Basic Next.js setup, React knowledge.

2. **Nested Routing** (Video 1)
   - Structure: `/blog` for the blog section, with nested routes like `/blog/posts` or `/blog/categories`.
   - Example: Clicking "Posts" takes you to `/blog/posts`.

3. **Dynamic Routing** (Video 2)
   - Create dynamic routes for individual blog posts, e.g., `/blog/posts/[postId]`.
   - Example: `/blog/posts/my-first-post` shows a specific post.

4. **Nested Dynamic Routing** (Video 3)
   - Add categories with dynamic posts, e.g., `/blog/categories/[category]/[postId]`.
   - Example: `/blog/categories/tech/nextjs-intro` for a tech-related post.

5. **Catch-All Routes** (Video 4)
   - Use `[...filePath]` to handle deeper or invalid URLs gracefully.
   - Example: `/blog/random/undefined/path` could redirect or show a custom message.

6. **Reusable Layouts** (Video 5)
   - Create a layout component with a header, footer, and sidebar that wraps all pages.
   - Example: Every page (home, blog, post) shares the same navigation bar.

7. **Metadata API** (Video 6)
   - Add dynamic metadata (e.g., title, description) for each page or post.
   - Example: The post page `/blog/posts/my-first-post` has a unique title like "My First Post | Blog".

8. **Custom Not Found Page** (Video 7)
   - Design a custom 404 page for invalid routes (e.g., `/blog/nonexistent`).
   - Example: "Oops! This post doesn’t exist."

9. **Route Groups** (Video 8)
   - Organize routes into groups like `(blog)` for cleaner file structure without affecting URLs.
   - Example: Group all blog-related routes under `(blog)` folder, but URL remains `/blog`.

#### How to Build It (Step-by-Step):
1. **Setup Next.js Project**
   - Run `npx create-next-app@latest my-blog` and choose the App Router (recommended for modern Next.js).

2. **File Structure**
   ```
   my-blog/
   ├── app/
   │   ├── layout.js          // Reusable layout (Video 5)
   │   ├── page.js           // Homepage
   │   ├── (blog)/           // Route group (Video 8)
   │   │   ├── page.js       // /blog (Blog landing page)
   │   │   ├── posts/
   │   │   │   ├── [postId]/
   │   │   │   │   ├── page.js  // Dynamic post page (Video 2)
   │   │   ├── categories/
   │   │   │   ├── [category]/
   │   │   │   │   ├── [postId]/
   │   │   │   │   │   ├── page.js  // Nested dynamic route (Video 3)
   │   │   ├── [...filePath]/
   │   │   │   ├── page.js   // Catch-all route (Video 4)
   │   ├── not-found.js      // Custom 404 page (Video 7)
   ├── public/               // Static assets (e.g., images)
   ├── styles/               // CSS (optional)
   ```

3. **Implementation**
   - **Homepage (`app/page.js`)**: List 2-3 fake blog posts (hardcoded data for simplicity).
   - **Blog Section (`app/(blog)/page.js`)**: Intro to the blog with links to posts or categories.
   - **Dynamic Posts (`app/(blog)/posts/[postId]/page.js`)**: Use `params.postId` to display a post title and content (e.g., "Post: {postId}").
   - **Nested Dynamic Routes (`app/(blog)/categories/[category]/[postId]/page.js`)**: Show category and post details (e.g., "Category: {category}, Post: {postId}").
   - **Catch-All Route (`app/(blog)/[...filePath]/page.js`)**: Display a message like "You’ve gone too deep! Here’s what you entered: {filePath}".
   - **Layout (`app/layout.js`)**: Add a `<nav>` with links to Home and Blog, and wrap `{children}`.
   - **Metadata (`app/(blog)/posts/[postId]/page.js`)**: Export a `metadata` object with `title: "Post: " + params.postId`.
   - **404 Page (`app/not-found.js`)**: Simple "Page Not Found" with a link back to home.

4. **Styling**
   - Use CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS (if installed) to make it look clean and presentable.

5. **Data**
   - For speed, hardcode 2-3 posts (e.g., `{ id: "my-first-post", title: "My First Post", category: "tech" }`). Later, you can fetch from a JSON file or API.

#### Example Output:
- `/` → "Welcome to My Blog" with links to posts.
- `/blog` → "Blog Section" with navigation.
- `/blog/posts/my-first-post` → "My First Post" with fake content.
- `/blog/categories/tech/nextjs-intro` → "Tech: Next.js Intro" post.
- `/blog/anything/wrong` → Catch-all message or 404 page.

#### Tips for Success:
- **Keep it Simple**: Focus on functionality over complex design.
- **Presentable**: Add basic CSS (e.g., a header, some colors) to impress visually.
- **Fast Completion**: Hardcode data instead of setting up a database/API.
- **Explain in Presentation**: Highlight how each feature ties to a video (e.g., "This dynamic route uses Video 2’s concept").

#### Next Steps:
If you finish early, add:
- A search bar (static for now).
- Fake comments section to show React skills.
- An image (e.g., blog banner) and ask me to generate one if needed.
